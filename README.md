### Messy Notes from class 1/31 for project 1:

#### Overall ideas
* Big chunk of credit from testing
* Formatting, formatting, everything formatting
* All artifacts (including private methods) must be documented, basically comment everything
* Review list at top of assignment to make sure we have everything she wants
* ONLY SUBMIT A .zip FILE
* Infinite submissions until due date, last submission graded
* Check javadoc before submission
* If its not mentioned, probably wont loose points
* Really use the document (there is set up for code, point breakdowns, all requirements, etc)

### Topics and Code
* Focus on what was learned the 1st 2 weeks of class
* Boundry --> roster manager, class handling I/O and control
* Entity objs --> student, roster, profile, major, completed credits, etc (the data points)
* Use scanner for I/O
* Match her code examples & project requirements
* Package format is /somewhere/ on the canvas site, idk she said "I showed you last time", no name specification, use package keyword
  * right click src file --> new --> new package
* have a run class public class 

RunProject { public static void main(String[] args) { new RosterManager().run(); } }

* Project should ignore empty lines
  * Test invalid input and blank input, and quitting manager
* "Roster manager terminated" at end of run
* No need to read data from external file --> just test in terminal
